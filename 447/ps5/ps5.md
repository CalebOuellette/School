(8ms * .3 + 20ms * .7 + 100ns)*p + (1-p)100ns = 200ns. 
Solve for p. 
Page fault rate has to be 6.09756Ã—10^-6 %.

    a. Yes you could recreate the list by brute force. You would have to look at all saved files and where they are stored, and use that data to derive were the free blocks are.

    b. 7 I/O Operations. Two for each directory (current, a, then b) and then one for the file it's self (c). 

    c. Log strucutre where all operations are first written to a log before they are performed and remove after they complete. If a system failure happens, the log can re-create what should happen.
