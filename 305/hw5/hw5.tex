  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Analysis of d-ary heaps (problem 6-2 in the text).
  
   A \textbf{d-ary heap} is like a binary heap, but (with one possible
   exception) non-leaf nodes have $d$ children instead of 2 children.
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item How would you represent a $d$-ary heap in an array?
    Use the same strucutre as a binary tree, exect use h instead of 2. So the root is still at one, 
    then its h children. After that is the h children on the left child of the first node and so on.
     \item What is the height of a $d$-ary heap of $n$ elements in terms
       of $n$ and $d$? \\
       \begin{equation*}
        \floor*{log_h n}
       \end{equation*}

     \item Give an efficient implementation of \textsc{Extract-Max} in
         a $d$-ary max-heap.  Analyze its running time in terms of $d$
         and $n$.
         \begin{codebox}
          \Procname{$\proc{Extract-Max}(A)$}
          \li \If $n < 1$ \Do
          \li \Error ``heap underflow''
        \End
        \li $max \gets A[1]$
        \li $A[1] = A[n]$
        \li $n = n-1$
        \li $\proc{Max-Heapify}(A,1,n)$
        \li \Return $max$
        \end{codebox}
        \ The Extract-Max function will be dominated by Max-Heapify. Max-Heapify will take $\Theta(log_h n)$ time.



       \item Give an efficient implementation of \textsc{Insert} in
         a $d$-ary max-heap.  Analyze its running time in terms of $d$
         and $n$.
       \item Give an efficient implementation of
         \textsc{Increase-Key}$(A,i,k)$,
         which flags an error if $k < A[i]$, but otherwise sets $A[i] =
         k$ and then updates the $d$-ary max-heap structure
         appropriately.    Analyze its running time in terms of $d$
         and $n$.
