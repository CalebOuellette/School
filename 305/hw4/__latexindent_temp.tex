    Explain the reasoning behind each answer.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
    \item
      Suppose we shuffle a deck of 10 cards, each bearing a distinct
      number from 1 to 10, to mix the cards thoroughly.  We then remove
      three cards, one at a time, from the deck.  What is the probability
      that we select the three cards in sorted (increasing) order?
      \\
      \\
      Choose any 3 cards. There are 3! combinations of ways that you could have drawn. Of the those 6 only 1 is sorted. So 1/6.
    
    \item
      Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem,
      known as the {\bf hat-check problem}.
      Each of $n$ customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a
      restaurant.  The hat-check person gives the hats back to the customers
      in a random order.  What is the expected number of customers who get
      back their own hat?
      \\
      
      
      \begin{align*}
      X_h &= I\{\mbox{Getting the correct hat back\}}\\
      X_h &= 1/n \\
      E[X] &= E\left[\sum_{k = 1}^n X_h\right] \\
      E[X] &= \sum_{k = 1}^n E[X_h] \\
      E[X] &= \sum_{k = 1}^n 1/n \\
      E[X] &= n/n \\
      E[X] &= 1 \\
      \end{align*}
      The expected number of customers who get there hat back is 1 for any n.
